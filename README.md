## üîπ 1. What is the difference between _Divide and Conquer_ and _Dynamic Programming_ algorithms?

### Answer

Both **Divide and Conquer** and **Dynamic Programming** are algorithmic paradigms that break problems down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.

While they share similarities such as the use of **recursion** and the need for an **optimal substructure**, they also differ in key ways.

### Common Features

- **Recursion**: Both paradigms employ recursive techniques.
- **Optimal Substructure**: Solutions to the overall problem are constructed from optimal solutions of its sub-problems.
- **Complexity**: Time and space complexities help evaluate algorithmic efficiency.

### Key Distinctions

- **Sub-Problems Dependency**: 
   - Divide and Conquer: Sub-problems are independent.
   - Dynamic Programming: Sub-problems often overlap and are dependent.

- **Intermediate Results**: 
   - Divide and Conquer: No storage of intermediate outcomes.
   - Dynamic Programming: Uses memoization or tabulation to store intermediate results, reducing redundant calculations.

### Code Example: Fibonacci Sequence

Here is the Python code:

```python
# Divide and Conquer for Fibonacci
def fibonacci_divide_conquer(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci_divide_conquer(n-1) + fibonacci_divide_conquer(n-2)

# Dynamic Programming for Fibonacci with memoization
def fibonacci_memoization(n, memo={}):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    if n not in memo:
        memo[n] = fibonacci_memoization(n-1, memo) + fibonacci_memoization(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```

In this example, `fibonacci_divide_conquer` uses Divide and Conquer without any storage mechanism. `fibonacci_memoization` leverages Dynamic Programming and memoizes results to avoid redundant calculations.

## üîπ 2. Compare _Greedy_ vs _Divide & Conquer_ vs _Dynamic Programming_ algorithms.

### Answer

Let's explore how **Greedy**, **Divide & Conquer**, and **Dynamic Programming** algorithms differ across key metrics such as optimality, computational complexity, and memory usage. 

### Key Metrics

- **Optimality**: Greedy may not guarantee optimality, while both Divide & Conquer and Dynamic Programming do.
- **Computational Complexity**: Greedy is generally the fastest; Divide & Conquer varies, and Dynamic Programming can be slower but more accurate.
- **Memory Usage**: Greedy is most memory-efficient, Divide & Conquer is moderate, and Dynamic Programming can be memory-intensive due to caching.

### Greedy Algorithms

Choose Greedy algorithms when a **local** best choice leads to a **global** best choice.

#### Use Cases
- **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph.
- **Text Compression**: Huffman Coding for compressing text files.
- **Network Routing**: For minimizing delay or cost in computer networks.
- **Task Scheduling**: For scheduling tasks under specific constraints to optimize for time or cost.

### Divide & Conquer Algorithms

Opt for Divide & Conquer when you can solve **independent subproblems** and combine them for the **global optimum**.

#### Use Cases

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Quick sort and Merge sort for efficient sorting of lists or arrays.
- **Search Algorithms**: Binary search for finding an element in a sorted list.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Strassen's algorithm for faster matrix multiplication.
- **Computational Geometry**: Algorithms for solving geometric problems like finding the closest pair of points.

### Dynamic Programming Algorithms

Choose Dynamic Programming when overlapping subproblems can be **solved once and reused**.

#### Use Cases

- **Optimal Path Problems**: Finding the most cost-efficient path in a grid or graph, such as in the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
- **Text Comparison**: Algorithms like the Levenshtein distance for spell checking and DNA sequence alignment.
- **Resource Allocation**: Knapsack problem for optimal resource allocation under constraints.
- **Game Theory**: Minimax algorithm for decision-making in two-player games.

## üîπ 3. What is _Merge Sort_?

### Answer

**Merge Sort** is a robust and efficient divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It breaks down a list into numerous sublists until each sublist consists of a single element and then merges these sublists in a sorted manner.

### Key Characteristics

- **Divide and Conquer**: Segments the list recursively into halves until individual elements are achieved.
- **Stable**: Maintains the order of equal elements.
- **External**: Requires additional memory space, leading to a linear space complexity $O(n)$.
- **Non-Adaptive**: Does not benefit from existing order in a dataset.

### Advantages

- **Consistent Performance**: Merge Sort guarantees a time complexity of $O(n \log n)$ across best, average, and worst-case scenarios.
- **Parallelizable**: Its design allows for efficient parallelization in multi-core systems.
- **Widely Used**: Due to its reliable performance, it's employed in many systems, including the `sort()` function in some programming languages.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Divide**: If the list has more than one element, split the list into two halves.
2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort both halves.
3. **Merge**: Combine (merge) the sorted halves to produce a single sorted list.

### Visual Representation

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: Best, Average, and Worst Case: $O(n \log n)$ - Due to the consistent halving and merging process.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$ - Additional space is required for the merging process.

### Code Example: Merge Sort

Here is the Python code:

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left = arr[:mid]
        right = arr[mid:]

        merge_sort(left)
        merge_sort(right)

        i = j = k = 0

        while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
            if left[i] < right[j]:
                arr[k] = left[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

        while i < len(left):
            arr[k] = left[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1

        while j < len(right):
            arr[k] = right[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1

    return arr
```

## üîπ 4. What is _QuickSort_?

### Answer

**QuickSort** is a highly efficient divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that partitions an array into subarrays using a **pivot element**, separating elements less than and greater than the pivot.

### Key Characteristics

- **Divide and Conquer**: Uses a pivot to partition the array into two parts and then sorts them independently.
- **In-Place**: Requires minimal additional memory, having a space complexity of $O(\log n)$ due to recursive call stack.
- **Unstable**: Does not maintain the relative order of equal elements.

### Advantages

- **Versatile**: Can be tweaked for better performance in real-world situations.
- **Cache-Friendly**: Often exhibits good cache performance due to its in-place nature.
- **Parallelizable**: Its divide-and-conquer nature allows for efficient parallelization in multi-core systems.

### Disadvantages

- **Worst-Case Performance**: QuickSort has a worst-case time complexity of $O(n^2)$, although this behavior is rare, especially with good pivot selection strategies.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Pivot Selection**: Choose an element from the array as the pivot. 
2. **Partitioning**: Reorder the array so that all elements smaller than the pivot come before, while all elements greater come after it. The pivot is then in its sorted position.
3. **Recursive Sort**: Recursively apply the above steps to the two sub-arrays (elements smaller than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot).

### Visual Representation

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Best and Average Case: $O(n \log n)$ - When the partition process divides the array evenly.
  - Worst Case: $O(n^2)$ - When the partition process divides the array into one element and $n-1$ elements, typically when the list is already sorted.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(\log n)$ - Due to the recursive call stack.

### Code Example: QuickSort

Here is the Python code:

```python
def quick_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)
```
